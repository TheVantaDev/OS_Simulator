  Aurora OS evolves in clearly defined stages: first as a functional desktop OS
  sandbox, then as a playable single-player hacking game, and finally as a
  persistent multiplayer hacking experience.

# Roadmap

Versioning follows semantic principles _(_[_explained_](roadmap.md#version-number-meaning)_)_:

### 🔢 Version Number Meaning

#### MAJOR (`x.0.0`)

Incremented when **fundamental system paradigms change**.

This includes:

* Breaking changes to internal or external APIs
* Core architecture rewrites _(filesystem, runtime, process model)_
* Major UX paradigm shifts
* Removal or redesign of existing core systems
* Any change that breaks backward compatibility

**Examples:**

* `1.0.0` — Aurora transitions from OS-only to playable game
* `2.0.0` — Multiplayer and persistent world architecture introduced

> Major versions are **rare and intentional**.

***

#### MINOR (`x.y.0`)

Incremented when **new functionality or meaningful expansion** is added **without breaking compatibility**.

This is the most common increment during active development.

**Triggers**

**Core App Graduation**

* App transitions from placeholder to functional
* Real UI, filesystem integration, persistence

**System & UX Expansion**

* New desktop workflows
* Improved window management
* Onboarding improvements
* New system utilities

**Examples:**

* `0.3.0` — Desktop interactions stabilized
* `0.4.0` — File associations implemented
* `1.1.0` — Expanded onboarding and player systems

***

#### PATCH (`x.y.z`)

Incremented for **fixes and polish only**.

Patch releases:

* Do not introduce new features
* Do not break existing behavior

**Triggers**

* Bug fixes
* Performance improvements
* UI and consistency polish
* Edge-case handling

**Examples:**

* `0.4.1` — Fix file save bug
* `1.2.3` — Improve startup performance

***

### 🧩 Commit → Version Mapping (Guideline)

Recommended commit conventions:

* `feat:` → **MINOR** bump
* `fix:` → **PATCH** bump
* `feat!:` or breaking change → **MAJOR** bump
* `refactor:` → PATCH unless behavior changes

This enables predictable versioning and future automation.
